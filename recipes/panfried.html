        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pan Fried Noodles are my personal favorite dish 
            because I have been eating this noodle style since I was in middle 
            school. The name for Pan Fried Noodles can be different from Chow 
            Mein, for a traditional texture and taste, or Lo Mein, for a thicker 
            texture. Pan Fried Noodles comes from Shanghai And Suzhou. 
            Over time, the dish becomes a popular tradition for lunch or dinner.

            <li>2 scallions</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>

                8 oz. fresh thin Hong Kong Style Egg Noodles (225g; 
                for pan-frying, not to be mistaken for “wonton noodles,”

                pan-frying)
            </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Steps needed to cook the recipe -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Rinse the bean sprouts in 
                cold water and drain. Julienne the scallions. Mix the soy 
                sauces, sesame oil, salt, sugar, wine and white pepper in a 
                small bowl and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Boil the noodles. Fresh noodles should be boiled for about 
                1 minute. For dried noodles, boil for 2 minutes. Rinse in cold 
                water and drain very well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the wok over high heat and add a tablespoon of oil to coat 
                the wok (you can also use a cast iron or non-stick pan for 
                this). Spread the noodles in a thin, even layer on the wok and 
                tilt the wok in a circular motion to distribute the oil and 
                crisp the bottom layer of the noodles evenly. It should take 
                about 5 minutes for the first side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip the noodles over. add another tablespoon of oil around 
                the perimeter of the wok, and let the other side crisp up. 
                Don’t stress if you can’t turn the noodles over in one shot. 
                The goal here is just to get an even crispness and to dry out 
                the noodles during this cooking stage. Set the noodles aside 
                on a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the wok over high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil and all of 
                the white parts of the scallion to the pan. Cook for about 15 
                seconds. Next, add the noodles to the wok and toss them well, 
                breaking up the noodles so they’re not all in one big clump. 
                Add the soy sauce mixture and toss continuously for a couple 
                minutes. Keep the heat on high.
            </li>
            <li>
                After the noodles are uniformly golden brown, add the bean 
                sprouts and toss. Add the rest of the scallions and toss the 
                mixture again for another 1 to 2 minutes until you see the bean 
                sprouts just starting to turn transparent. You want the sprouts 
                to be cooked but still crunchy.
