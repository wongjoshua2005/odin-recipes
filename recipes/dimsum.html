        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            There are multiple ways to view the origins of Dim Sum. 
            Cantonese Dim Sum was originally based on local foods. 
            After the creation of Dim Sum, many people from different 
            parts of China influenced and added more ingredients to make 
            the flavor and texture unique to their style. Guangdong alone 
            has over one thousand Dim Sum dishes compared to other areas 
            in China.
