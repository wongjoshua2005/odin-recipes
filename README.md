# odin-recipes

This project focuses on teaching people how to make Chinese food. Made
by following through The Odin Project curriculum.

Reflection (HTML Only Recipe Project): I am surprised with how much work I need
to put into this website. Best part is that I am motivated to continue because
this project was fun to make! I will continue to update this website when I
learn more CSS and JavaScript.
